<!-- ### Instructions

1. Create a new project folder. Inside, create a new HTML file and name it `index.html`. Fill this document in with a basic HTML skeleton.

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook, and open any previous project created using `matplotlib`. Download all images of graphs created with pyplot to your local project folder.

3. At the top of the HTML page, add a H1 tag containing the name of your chosen project.

4. For each downloaded image, add one image element to your `index.html` file. Set the `src` attribute of each image to the path to a different image in your project folder. Be sure to add a description for each image in the `alt` attribute.

5. Add a horizontal rule between each image.

6. Underneath each image, add a description of its graph in italicized text using the `<em>` element.

7. Add functionality so that when an image is clicked, it will open a new tab to that image's URL.

### Bonus

Take advantage of the `figure` and `figcaption` elements to have more semantic markup.
